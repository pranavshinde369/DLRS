# Changelog

All notable changes to the DLRS project will be documented in this file.

## v0.5 Draft (2026-04-26)

**Status**: RFC. Introduces the v0.5 offline-first build pipelines (ASR / text /
vectorization / moderation), a derived-asset provenance schema, and the
single-entrypoint pipeline CLI. No breaking changes to v0.4 manifests; the new
pipelines write everything under `derived/<name>/` so existing records are
untouched until a pipeline is explicitly run against them.

### Added

- `pipelines/` directory with the v0.5 pipeline contract:
  - `pipelines/__init__.py` — `PipelineSpec` registry + dispatcher.
  - `pipelines/_descriptor.py` — shared `DescriptorBuilder` that emits
    `<output>.descriptor.json` validated against
    `schemas/derived-asset.schema.json`.
  - `pipelines/asr/` — `dummy` (deterministic, no model) and `faster-whisper`
    (lazy-imported, opt-in) backends.
  - `pipelines/text/` — NFKC normalisation + conservative redaction (emails,
    CN phone, CN ID, IBAN, IPv4/IPv6, generic passport). `redactions.json`
    sidecar is auditable without re-leaking matched substrings.
  - `pipelines/vectorization/` — paragraph-aware chunking with absolute char
    offsets, `hash` (deterministic 64-D) and `sentence-transformers` backends,
    optional Qdrant push (`backend` and `model_id` stored as separate
    payload keys so downstream filters work without ambiguity).
  - `pipelines/moderation/` — deterministic regex/wordlist policy with
    severity-based outcome aggregation (`pass | flag | block`). Built-in
    v0.5 policy + `--policy-file` for JSON/YAML overrides. Flags carry
    rule + span only, **never** the matched substring.
- `tools/run_pipeline.py` — single CLI entrypoint (`python tools/run_pipeline.py
  <name> --record path/to/record …`) shared by every pipeline.
- `tools/validate_pipelines.py` — static guard: enforces the
  `derived/<spec.name>/` output-prefix invariant and refuses any module that
  imports a hosted-API client (`openai`, `anthropic`, `google.generativeai`,
  `cohere`, `aliyun_sdk_bailian`, …). This is what turns "offline-first" into
  machine-checked policy.
- `tools/test_pipelines.py` — umbrella test driver. Runs the four
  per-pipeline test scripts as subprocesses so an import failure in one
  pipeline cannot mask test results in another.
- `tools/test_asr_demo.py` — end-to-end test for `examples/asr-demo`.
- `schemas/derived-asset.schema.json` — provenance descriptor schema
  (derived_asset_id / pipeline / inputs[] / output / model / record_id /
  optional `moderation_outcome`).
- `examples/asr-demo/` — self-contained fixture record. `run_demo.sh`
  regenerates a deterministic placeholder WAV (DLRS is pointer-first so
  audio is never committed) and walks all four pipelines end-to-end with
  no model download.
- `docs/PIPELINE_GUIDE.md` — companion to the example. Covers the contract,
  the descriptor, every pipeline's CLI, authoring guide, and what v0.5
  deliberately is not.
- `.github/workflows/validate.yml`: dedicated `pipelines` job parallel to
  `validate`, matrix over Python 3.11 and 3.12.

### Changed

- `tools/batch_validate.py`: collapsed the four per-pipeline tests into a
  single `pipelines` step delegating to `tools/test_pipelines.py`, then
  added `asr_demo` for the end-to-end fixture. Local report:
  `11/11 passed`.
- `docs/GAP_ANALYSIS.md` and `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` rewritten to
  reflect v0.5 (overall completion ~83%).
- `ROADMAP.md`: v0.5 marked as released, with the `Closes #N`-per-PR
  governance rule appended to the v0.5 section so future major versions
  inherit it.

### Closes

#28 (epic), #29, #30, #31, #32, #33, #34, #35, #36, #37, #38.

## v0.4 Draft (2026-04-26)

**Status**: RFC. Tightens the v0.3 schemas, makes AI disclosure machine-checked
for any public record, formalises the audit event log, and ships a static HTML
public registry. No breaking changes to v0.3 manifests beyond the new
conditional requirement on `public_disclosure` for `visibility = public_*`.

### Added

- `tools/batch_validate.py` — orchestrator that runs every validator
  (`check_sensitive_files`, `lint_schemas`, `validate_repo`, `validate_examples`,
  `validate_media`, `test_registry`, `build_registry`) and writes a single
  machine-readable report to `reports/validate_<utc-ts>.json`.
- `tools/emit_audit_event.py` — append-only writer for `audit/events.jsonl`,
  including a SHA-256 hash chain (`prev_hash` / `hash`) and refusal to rewrite
  existing `event_id`s.
- `docs/COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md` — PIPL / GDPR / EU AI Act / 中国深度合成办法
  self-check, mapping each clause to a manifest field and a validator.
- `docs/LFS_GUIDE.md` — when to use Git LFS vs object-storage pointers, and a
  recipe for migrating an accidentally committed binary.
- Static HTML public registry: `tools/build_registry.py` now also writes
  `registry/index.html` (zero JS, inline CSS) alongside the existing JSONL/CSV.
- Examples: `examples/minor-protected/` and `examples/estate-conflict-frozen/`
  encode the two negative cases that registry generation must exclude.
- `tools/test_registry.py` adds two corresponding cases (now 14 total).

### Changed

- `schemas/manifest.schema.json`: added `public_disclosure` (with
  `ai_disclosure`, `label_text_required`, `label_locales[]`,
  `watermark_methods[]`, `c2pa_claim_generator`, `impersonation_disclaimer`).
  An `if/then` clause makes `public_disclosure` mandatory whenever
  `visibility ∈ {public_indexed, public_unlisted}`. Added optional
  `audit.events_log_ref`.
- `schemas/audit-event.schema.json`: tightened `event_type` to the eight
  canonical lifecycle events plus `custom`, restricted `actor_role` to a
  closed enum, added `evidence_ref`, `prev_hash`, `metadata`, and a
  hash-format pattern for `hash`. `additionalProperties` is now `false`.
- `.gitattributes`: added a comprehensive LFS routing list (audio, video,
  raw images, 3D / avatar formats, model weights, archives) plus
  `text eol=lf` normalisation for source files.
- `.github/workflows/validate.yml`: now also runs `batch_validate.py`,
  uploads `reports/` and `registry/index.html` as artefacts, and adds a
  separate non-blocking docs job (markdownlint + lychee linkcheck).
- `tools/build_registry.py`: emits HTML in addition to JSONL + CSV.
- `docs/GAP_ANALYSIS.md` and `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` rewritten to
  reflect the post-v0.3 + v0.4 reality (overall completion ~78%).

### Closes

#17, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, #25, #26.

## v0.3 Draft (2026-04-26)

**Status**: RFC (Request for Comments) stage — minimum viable repository goals.

### Added
- `docs/COLLECTION_STANDARD.md` — minimum media collection standard (audio,
  video, image, text, 3D) with hard rules and validation checklist.
- `docs/HIGH_FIDELITY_GUIDE.md` — aspirational high-fidelity collection
  guide and quality rubric.
- `docs/OBJECT_STORAGE_POINTERS.md` — formal pointer specification covering
  `s3://`, `oss://`, `cos://`, `minio://`, `obj://`, `repo://` schemes with
  required and forbidden fields.
- `tools/validate_media.py` — pointer media-metadata validator that enforces
  the minimum-collection thresholds (and optionally cross-checks local
  samples via `ffprobe`).
- `tools/lint_schemas.py` — Draft 2020-12 schema linter.
- `tools/validate_examples.py` — validates every `examples/*` archive.
- `tools/test_registry.py` — 12 unit tests for the public-registry
  inclusion / exclusion / data-integrity rules.
- `tools/upload_to_storage.py` — reference uploader for S3/OSS/COS/MinIO
  that emits a DLRS-conformant pointer file.
- `tools/estimate_costs.py` — monthly storage + egress cost projection.
- `.github/workflows/validate.yml` — restored CI pipeline (lint schemas,
  validate manifests, validate media metadata, run registry tests, build
  registry).
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/takedown-request.yml`,
  `consent-withdrawal.yml`, `impersonation-dispute.yml` — privacy-aware
  GitHub Issue Forms with explicit warnings against attaching sensitive
  material publicly.

### Changed
- `schemas/pointer.schema.json` — added `artifact_type`,
  `media_metadata`, `encryption`, `retention_days`,
  `withdrawal_supported`, `consent_ref`, `review_status`, `provenance`;
  enforced `storage_uri` scheme allow-list and `checksum` format; forbade
  fields that would leak credentials or public download URLs.
- `schemas/consent.schema.json` — required `consent_version`,
  `captured_at`, `withdrawal_endpoint`, `allowed_scopes`; added
  `expires_at`, `signer`, scope enumeration.
- `schemas/public-profile.schema.json` — descriptions and an enum for
  `allowed_public_interactions` (preserving legacy values for
  backwards compatibility).
- `schemas/manifest.schema.json` — `schema_version` now accepts
  `0.2.x` and `0.3.x`; added descriptions and examples to top-level
  fields; relaxed `record_id` length to ≥ 4 to match existing examples.
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/human-record.md` — full rewrite with
  consent / sensitive-materials / public-registry / withdrawal /
  reviewer-notes checklists.
- Replaced placeholder URLs and emails (`your-org/dlrs-hub`,
  `*@example.org`) with the canonical
  `Digital-Life-Repository-Standard/DLRS` repo, GitHub Discussions, and
  GitHub Security Advisories. Example/template manifest data was left
  intentionally fictional per issue #7's scope.

### Deprecated
- Schema `$id` URLs starting with `https://example.org/dlrs/` — replaced by
  `https://dlrs.standard/schemas/`. Existing manifests continue to validate.

### Notes
- Closes issues #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15.
- Still draft / RFC. v0.4 will add full GitHub Actions CI/CD coverage,
  Git LFS configuration, batch validation reports, and a minimal Web UI.
